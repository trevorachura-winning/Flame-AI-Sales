## 📋 Data Requirements

For the AI engine to successfully train and extract insights, uploaded datasets must meet the following criteria:
1. **Format:** Standard `.csv` file.
2. **Timeline:** Must contain at least one valid Date column (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`).
3. **Target Metric:** Must contain at least one purely numeric financial/sales column (no `$` or commas).
4. **Volume:** A minimum of 6 chronological data points (rows) is required to train the AI, though 20+ is highly recommended for confident R-Squared validation.
5. **Categorization:** Text-based columns (e.g., *Neighborhood, Acquisition Channel*) are required to utilize the Lead Scoring matrix.
